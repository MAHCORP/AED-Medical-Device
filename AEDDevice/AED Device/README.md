2. Each member actively participated in each segment of the project. We all collaborated on the design, discussed together, and implemented based on our calls. Basing this on who played major roles in specific elements:


Xinchen focused and implemented the design.
Jingyu implemented the UI, the ECG, the CPR, and the audio, followed by other implementations.
Mohammad took care of the pads, the heart monitor, the system check, followed by other implementations.


3. Organization of Submission:
When unzipped, you can see the AED folder which contains the src folder. This contains the major parts of the code for the AED application, as well as the assets which contain both audio, and images which were used and implemented in the application. Other than the src, we have the .gitignore as well as the Readme.
